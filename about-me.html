<h2> My background</h2>
</center>
<div> <p align="justify">

I was a student in the Riga Secondary School No.10 <i>(Rīgas 10. vidusskola)</i> throughout all my primary
and secondary education (2011-2023). Somewhere in eighth grade, I discovered the subject of chemistry which
appeared very interesting to me, thus I began actively studying the subject myself guided by my amazing 
secondary school chemistry teacher. In ninth grade, I first participated in the Latvian chemistry Olympiad,
where I scored the gold medal and was invited to the preparatory camp for the International Olympiad team. 
Next year, I qualified the IChO team and scored a silver medal at sixteen years old during the Olympiad in Osaka.
After that, I decided to pursue research and teaching in a more serious way. I have worked for a year at the Latvian
Institute of Organic Synthesis Organic Synthesis Methodology (LOSI OSM) group in the lab of Dr. Liene Grigorjeva,
under the guidance of her graduate students Aleksandrs Čižikovs and Lūkass Lukašēvics. During my work, I realised I liked
the theoretical aspects way more than the practical aspects of chemistry, thus I slowly shifted towards my current 
field of interest.<br><br>

I have participated in various <a href = "pubs.html">student research conferences</a> with the paper describing my research in the Grigorjeva lab.
After that, I worked for half a year in the Konrāde lab in Riga Technical University Institute of Chemistry and Chemical Technology
where I developed fluorescent dyes and worked on quantifying their fluorescence spectral properties such as quantum yield.<br><br>

When I graduated my school, I moved to Singapore to pursue an undegraduate degree in Chemistry and Biological Chemistry at 
Nanyang Technological University (NTU) College of Science, where I began seriously studying the physical and mathematical aspects
of Chemistry due to the possibility to attend School of Physical and Mathematical Sciences (SPMS) courses during my degree. After my first year,
I was offered an opportunity to work under Dr Lu Yunpeng on developing numerical algorithms for solving the Schrodinger equation
using discrete-ordinate methods to simplify the calculation of the potential energy matrix by orders of magnitude. Those algorithms
can further be applied for modelling elementary reaction step kinetics. <br><br>

I am also working on some other <a href="projects-list.html">projects</a> outside of NTU, such as developing MD software with integrated
DFT force computation, teaching the IChO teams of Estonia and Latvia and much more.

<h2> My Interests</h2>
</center>
<div> <p align="justify">
I was always very interested in sharing my knowledge with others. I have been <a href = "teaching-home.html"> 
teaching STEM subjects</a> since I was 14 years old. Now, I am a Peer Tutor at the NTU Division of Chemistry and 
Biological Chemistry as well as a lecturer on Physical Chemistry in the IChO preparatory camps of Latvia and Estonia. <br><br>

I have been involved in a variety of student organisations, most of them overlapping with my interests. I have been 
member of my NTU Residential Hall's Residential Education portfolio subcommittee throughout all my time of study in NTU.
To educate the university students about the deep culture of traditional foods and beverages in other places as well as 
in order to promote responsible drinking, I've served as Events Director of NTU Wine Society since 2024.<br><br>

In my free time, I like to read a physics book, or watch some documentary with some good tea. I also enjoy cooking.
