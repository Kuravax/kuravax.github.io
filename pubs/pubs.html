<h2> Who am I?</h2>
</center>
 <div> <p align="justify">
I am an aspiring computational scientist. At this point, I am a student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
(NTU) pursuing a degree in Chemistry. I have been interested in research since I was fifteen. Currently I'm working as an 
undergraduate researcher at the group of Dr Lu Yunpeng, working on development of algorithms for numerical solution of 
Schrodinger equations using potential discretization methods. <br>
I have been a succesful Science Olympiad participant, and nowadays I am helping write competition problems for such esteemed contests
as the Baltic Chemistry Olympiad, where I also coach the national teams of Baltic nations for the International Chemistry Olympiad. You 
can find my recommended reading and study guides for Chemistry Olympiads <a href="teaching/teaching-home.html">here</a>.
