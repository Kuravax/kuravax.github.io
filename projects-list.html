Currently I'm working on a variety of different projects. Here is a brief summary of the most significant ones up-to-date:
</p>
<blockquote align="justify">

        -<i><b>HPC Algorithms for reaction dynamics on covalent surfaces</b> (2024 - present).</i> Our research group secured a HPC Research project from the National 
        Supercomputing Centre, Singapore (NSCC) to develop and benchmark scalable HPC applications that can be used for quantum reaction dynamics calculations of
        dissociation reactions on active sites of 2D periodic materials. I'm currently doing most of the physics, numerical method design, and code implementation, as well
        as debugging and benchmarking.<br>

        
        -<i><b>ML Potential Energy Surfaces for Surface reactions</b> (2024 - present).</i> For the reaction dynamics calculations, a high quality potential energy surface (PES)
        is necessary. ML methods can be used to accelerate PES generation by orders of magnitude. I've developed PES sampling and electronic calculation pipeline 
        schemes for regions of chemical interest, and a physically aware neural network interpolation scheme to interpolate the PES between the points of interest. 
        Weh have published our findings as a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0309397">Research Article </a> with the Journal of Chemical Physics.
