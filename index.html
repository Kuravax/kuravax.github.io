<h2> Who am I?</h2>

 <div> <p align="justify">
I am an aspiring computational scientist. At this point, I am a student in Nanyang Technological University, Singapore
(NTU) pursuing a degree in Chemistry. I have been participating in research since I was fifteen. Currently I'm working as an 
undergraduate researcher at the group of Dr Lu Yunpeng, working on development of high-performance computer algorithms for chemical 
reaction dynamics simulations using the time-dependent quantum reactive scattering theory. We also work with machine learning and 
neural networks for accelerating potential energy surface creation, as well as classical computational chemistry. My research interests 
lie in new theoretical approaches to handle complex gas-surface reactions on covalent catalysts for which you cannot apply classical
Born Oppenheimer static surface approximations or thermal averaging methods.<br>
<br> 
You can also find a list of my <a href="pubs.html">publications</a> and my  <a href="projects-list.html">projects</a>
on this website. <a href = "about-me/Resume_latex.pdf"> My full resume</a> is also hosted on this website.<br> <br>

I am a holder of various <a href = "about-me.html#Awards">awards and titles</a>, such as NTU President Research Scholar (2024), Latvian Prime Minister Prize for Academic Excellence
(2022, 2023) and a recipient of various scholarships, such as the Latvian Ministry of Finance Centenniary Excellence Scholarship (2023).<br><br> 
<!-- 
I have been a successful Science Olympiad participant. During my school years, I obtained three medals at the highest level of secondary-level academic 
competition in Chemistry - the International Chemistry Olympiad (IChO), Bronze in 2022, Silvers in 2021, 2023. Nowadays I am writing competition problems for such esteemed contests
as the Baltic Chemistry Olympiad and the Estonian National Chemistry Olympiad. I also coach the national teams of Baltic nations for the International Chemistry Olympiad. You 
can find my recommended reading and study guides for Chemistry Olympiads, as well of some of my recorded lectures for the Estonian
IChO preparatory camp <a href="teaching-home.html">here</a>.  -->

I also have been teaching Chemistry, Mathematics and Physics to others since my youth, and also occasionally write problems for various Chemistry contests. You can find some of my
materials <a href="teaching-home.html">here</a>.
